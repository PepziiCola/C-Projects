# C# Projects
These are various projects that I'll be creating in C#. All of these will be specifically for my school work.

I'll be putting these here at reference and cross usage across various computers.

Lab0 - Simply creating a project, making sure Visual Studio works properly, and displaying a message box after clicking a button.

### 1. [MessageBoxHello](https://github.com/PepziiCola/c-sharp/tree/main/MessageBoxHello)
Created using Visual Studio's Windows Form App (not the .NET, the C# one) and simply added a singular line of code. "MessageBox.Show("Hello user!")". Required less than 30 seconds of time to create the project and add the line of code. This is something that was actually interesting to me because C# is a language I'm wanting to learn. I want to learn the application side of it and seeing how quickly you could setup a window was very intriguing for me to want to learn this language further and use it to its full capabilities.

# C Projects
This is another public repository of mine that is mainly going to be used for very small projects. Most of these will just be the same as the labs I do for my school. 

I do not have very much intentions to write anything advanced in this repository. It's just another repository for my own learning and to reference in the future. 

### 1. [SimpleIO](https://github.com/PepziiCola/c-projects/tree/main/SimpleIO)
Very simple project of outputting. Probably improperly named IO as there is no input required to run and finish the program. It's just outputting various variables of different datatypes that represent numerous things. Simple project we did on 1/22 for Lab #1
